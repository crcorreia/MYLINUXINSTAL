The Bash Script Explained
This shell script appears to automate the installation of Docker and Docker Compose on a Linux system. Here's a breakdown of what each section of the script does:

Set Script Options:
set -o errexit
set -o nounset
IFS=$(printf '\n\t')
set -o errexit: The script will exit if any command exits with a non-zero status.
set -o nounset: The script will exit if it tries to use an uninitialized variable.
IFS=$(printf '\n\t'): Internal Field Separator is set to newline and tab.
